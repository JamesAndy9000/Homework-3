Basic Measurement Units
=======================

1 meter = <39.37> inches (Google search "meters to inches")
1 mile = <5280> feet (Google search "miles to feet")
1 mile = <1609.34> meters (Google search "miles to meters")
Circumference of the Earth = <24,901> miles (Google search "circumference of Earth")

Basic Terminology
=================

yotta something = <10^27> times something
kilo something = <1,000> times something
<hecto> something = 100 times something
<deca> something = 10 times something
something = something (duh!)
milli something = 1/<1,000> of something
micro something = 1/<1,000,000> of something
nano something = 1/<1,000,000,000> of something
<pico>something = 1/1,000,000,000,000 of something

From Physics
============

* What is the speed of light
	- = <186,282> mps (miles per second) (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light)
	- = <299,792.458> kps (kilometers per second) (Looked up "speed of light" in m/s, /1000)

Speed of electronic Signals
===========================

* How far an electronic signal can move through a wire:
	- In one nanosecond = <11.803> inches ((SoL in meters per second) \* (10^-9) \* (39.37)) (Linux calculator stinks.)
	- In one microsecond = <983.569> feet ((SoL in miles per second) \* (10^-6) \* (5280))
	- In one millisecond = <186.282> miles ((SoL in miles per second) / 1000)
	- In one second = <186,282> miles
	- In one second = <6.758> times around the Earth! ((Speed of Light in mi/s) / (Circumference of Earth))

From our World of Processors
